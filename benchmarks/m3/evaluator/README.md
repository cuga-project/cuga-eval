# VAKRA Evaluator

The `evaluator/` package replays predicted tool trajectories against the live VAKRA MCP environment and scores whether the final answer is both correct and grounded in tool outputs.

Rather than grading only the final text, the evaluator executes the submitted tool calls, injects fresh tool responses, and then combines deterministic checks with LLM-based judging to produce per-dialogue and per-domain scores.

Detailed evaluation is explained in our blog - https://huggingface.co/blog/ibm-research/vakra-benchmark-analysis#evaluation-framework

## What the Evaluator Does

For each capability and domain, the evaluator:

- loads ground-truth and prediction files
- pairs examples by `uuid`
- replays predicted and ground-truth tool calls through MCP
- injects tool responses back into each dialogue
- scores the predicted final turn using exact-match, correctness, and groundedness checks
- writes detailed per-dialogue results plus aggregated summaries

The current scorer evaluates the **last turn only** for each dialogue, even when the source dialogue contains multiple turns.

## Scoring Pipeline

Each paired dialogue is scored in the following order:

1. **Exact-match tool-response check**
   The evaluator first checks whether the expected ground-truth tool responses are present in the predicted tool responses.
2. **Answer correctness check**
   If exact match fails, an LLM judge compares the predicted answer against the ground-truth answer for the final turn. The correctness prompt is adapted from CRAG and is defined in [`prompt.py`](/vakra/evaluator/prompt.py).
3. **Groundedness check**
   If the answer is acceptable, another LLM judge verifies that the predicted answer is grounded in the executed tool outputs.
4. **PolicyAdheranceJudge**
   NOT INCLUDED: For the Multi-hop multi-source capability, we use a PolicyAdherenceJudge that programmatically checks the agent's application of a policy. This judge is currently not included for evaluation.

Turn scores are then aggregated into a dialogue score. The default aggregation policy in this repo is `mean`.

## Requirements

You will typically need the same setup used for running the benchmark itself:

- Python 3.10+
- benchmark dependencies installed with `pip install -r requirements_benchmark.txt`
- benchmark containers or MCP servers running and reachable via [`benchmark/mcp_connection_config.yaml`](/vakra/benchmark/mcp_connection_config.yaml)
- an OpenAI-compatible LLM configuration for the correctness and groundedness judges. We would be using `openai/gpt-oss-120b` internally for evaluation.

If you are setting up the benchmark from scratch, use the top-level guide in [`setup.md`](/vakra/setup.md).

## Input Layout

The evaluator expects one JSON file per domain in both the ground-truth and prediction directories.

```text
capability_dashboard_apis/
├── groundtruth/
│   ├── hockey.json
│   ├── movie.json
│   └── ...
└── prediction/
    ├── hockey.json
    ├── movie.json
    └── ...
```

Each file must be a JSON list of dialogue objects matched by `uuid`.

## Dialogue Format

Ground-truth and prediction files use the same top-level dialogue shape:

```json
{
  "uuid": "example_001",
  "domain": "finance",
  "additional_instructions": "Optional capability-specific instructions",
  "output": [
    {
      "turn_id": 0,
      "query": "What is the revenue of company X?",
      "answer": ["Company X reported $10M in revenue."],
      "sequence": {
        "tool_call": [
          {
            "name": "get_revenue",
            "arguments": {
              "company_name": "x"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

- prediction files should include the agent's generated `answer` and `sequence.tool_call`
- tool responses in predictions are not treated as authoritative; the evaluator re-executes the tool calls and injects fresh MCP outputs
- examples are paired by `uuid`
- missing predictions and extra predictions are reported in the results summary
- if a file contains duplicate `uuid` values, the evaluator keeps the last occurrence and silently overwrites earlier ones during pairing
- judge-based scoring considers at most the last 20 tool responses for a turn across all capabilities

## Running Evaluation

Run the evaluator from the repository root:

1) export `API_KEY=GROQ_API_KEY`

2) Run the evaluation script using the following command

```bash
python evaluator/evaluator.py \
  --capability_name capability_dashboard_apis \
  --gt_root data/test/capability_2_dashboard_apis/output \
  --pred_root output/capability_2_dashboard_apis/prediction \
  --output output/capability_2_dashboard_apis/results.json
```

Supported capability names:

- `capability_bi_apis`
- `capability_dashboard_apis`
- `capability_multihop_reasoning`
- `capability_multiturn`

Useful options:

```bash
python evaluator/evaluator.py \
  --capability_name capability_multiturn \
  --gt_root data/test/capability_4_multiturn/input \
  --pred_root output/capability_4_multiturn \
  --mcp-config benchmark/mcp_connection_config.yaml \
  --domains airline coffee \
  --output output/capability_4_multiturn/results.json
```

CLI arguments:

- `--capability_name`: capability registry key to evaluate
- `--gt_root`: directory containing ground-truth domain JSON files. One file per domain.
- `--pred_root`: directory containing prediction domain JSON files. One file per domain.
- `--output`: output file path; if omitted, defaults to `results.json` next to the capability directory
- `--mcp-config`: MCP connection YAML, defaulting to [`benchmark/mcp_connection_config.yaml`](/vakra/benchmark/mcp_connection_config.yaml)
- `--domains`: optional list of domain names to evaluate

## Output Format

The evaluator writes a single JSON report containing per-domain details and an overall summary.

```json
{
  "capability_name": "capability_dashboard_apis",
  "groundtruth_dir": "data/test/capability_2_dashboard_apis/input",
  "prediction_dir": "output/capability_2_dashboard_apis",
  "domains": {
    "hockey": {
      "domain": "hockey",
      "n_groundtruth": 100,
      "n_prediction": 100,
      "n_paired": 100,
      "missing_prediction_uuids": [],
      "extra_prediction_uuids": [],
      "dialogues": [
        {
          "uuid": "example_001",
          "score": 1.0,
          "metadata": {
            "capability": "capability_dashboard_apis",
            "domain": "hockey"
          },
          "details": {
            "dialogue_score": 1.0,
            "per_turn": []
          }
        }
      ],
      "summary": {
        "num_samples": 100,
        "num_correct": 81.0,
        "mean_dialogue_score": 0.81,
        "min_dialogue_score": 0.0,
        "max_dialogue_score": 1.0
      }
    }
  },
  "summary": {
    "n_domains": 1,
    "n_paired_dialogues": 100,
    "n_missing_predictions": 0,
    "n_extra_predictions": 0,
    "n_samples": 100,
    "n_correct": 81.0,
    "mean_dialogue_score": 0.81,
    "min_dialogue_score": 0.0,
    "max_dialogue_score": 1.0
  }
}
```

## Resume Behavior

The evaluator writes intermediate results after each domain. If the output file already exists and contains completed domains, rerunning the command will skip those domains and continue from the remaining ones.
